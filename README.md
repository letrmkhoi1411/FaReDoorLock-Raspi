# FaReDoorLock-Raspi
Facial Recognition Door Lock with Raspberry Pi
Our project is a smart door lock system based on Raspberry Pi. It combines advanced safety features with convenient access control.
Users can set and update passwords through a keypad, granting them the ability to unlock the door with a unique code.
Users can also unlock the door with their faces
Additionally, the lock incorporates a temperature sensor to detect high temperatures in the house, automatically opening the door in the event of a fire, providing a swift and safe escape route.
